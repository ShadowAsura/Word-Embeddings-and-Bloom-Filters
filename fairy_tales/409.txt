Deslongchamps, "Essai sur les Fables Indiennes," Paris, 1838, p. 35 and Grässe, "Sagenkreise des Mittelalters," Leipsig, 1842, p. 191. See also the numerous references given by Grimm, _KM._ iii. pp. 168-9.  [297] As well as in all the mythologies. For the magic draught of the fairy-story appears to be closely connected with the Greek _ambrosia_, the Vedic _soma_ or _amrita_, the Zend _haoma_.  [298] A water, "Das Wasser des Lebens," in two German stories (Grimm, Nos. 92 and 97, and iii. p. 178), and in many Greek tales (Hahn, Nos. 32, 37, &c.). An oil or ointment in the Norse tale (Asbjörnsen and Moe, No. 35, Dasent, No. 3). A balsam in Gaelic tales, in which a "Vessel of Balsam" often occurs. According to Mr. Campbell ("West Highland Tales," i. p. 218), "Ballan Iocshlaint, teat, of ichor, of health, seems to be the meaning of the words." The juice squeezed from the leaves of a tree in a modern Indian tale ("Old Deccan Days," p. 139).  [299] The mythical bird Garuda, the Indian original of the Roc of the Arabian Nights, was similarly connected with the Amrita. See the story of Garuda and the Nágas in Brockhaus's translation of the "Kathásaritságara," ii. pp. 98-105.

For a number of interesting legends, collected from the most distant parts of the world, about grinding mountains and crashing cliffs, &c., see Tylor's "Primitive Culture," pp. 313-16. After quoting three mythic descriptions found among the Karens, the Algonquins, and the Aztecs, Mr. Tylor remarks, "On the suggestion of this group of solar conceptions and that of Maui's death, we may perhaps explain as derived from a broken-down fancy of solar-myth, that famous episode of Greek legend, where the good ship Argo passed between the Symplêgades, those two huge cliffs that opened and closed again with swift and violent collision."  Several of the Modern Greek stories are very like the skazka mentioned above. In one of these (Hahn, ii. p. 234), a Lamia guards the water of life (ἀϐάνατο νερὸ) which flows within a rock; in another (ii. p. 280) a mountain opens at midday, and several springs are disclosed, each of which cries "Draw from me!" but the only one which is life-giving is that to which a bee flies.  [310] Wenzig, p. 148.  [311] Afanasief, _P.V.S._ ii. 353.  [312] See above, p. 233.  [313] _Silnaya voda_ or potent water, and _bezsilnaya voda_, or impotent water (_sila_ = strength).  [314] _Palitsa_ = a cudgel, etc. In the variant of the story quoted in the preceding section the prince seized Vikhor by the right little finger, _mizinets_. _Palets_ meant a finger. The similarity of the two words may have led to a confusion of ideas.  [315] Afanasief, vii. pp. 97-103.  [316] Muir's "Sanskrit Texts," v. p. 258 and p. 94. See, also Mannhardt's "Germ.

[319] In the original he is generally designated as _Katòma--dyàd'ka, dubovaya shàpka_, "Katòma-governor, oaken-hat." Not being able to preserve the assonance, I have dropped the greater part of his title.  [320] _Bogodanny_ (_bog_ = God; _dat'_, _davat'_ = to give). One of the Russian equivalents for our hideous "father-in-law" is "god-given father" (_bogodanny otets_), and for "mother-in-law," _bogodanny mat'_ or "God-given mother." (Dahl.)  [321] Four lines are omitted here. See A. de Gubernatis, "Zool. Mythology," i. 181, where a solar explanation of the whole story will be found.  [322] These ejaculations belong to the story-teller.  [323] Literally, "Seemed to her as small as a lamb."  [324] _Kolòdez_, a word connected with _kolòda_ a log, trough, &c.  [325] Afanasief, viii. No. 23 _a_.  [326] To this episode a striking parallel is offered by that of Gunther's wedding night in the "Nibelungenlied," in which Brynhild flings her husband Gunther across the room, kneels on his chest, and finally binds him hand and foot, and suspends him from a nail till daybreak. The next night Siegfried takes his place, and wrestles with the mighty maiden. After a long struggle he flings her on the floor and forces her to submit. Then he leaves the room and Gunther returns. A summary of the story will be found in the "Tales of the Teutonic Lands," by G. W. Cox and E. H. Jones, pp. 94-5.  [327] Khudyakof, i. No. 19. pp. 73-7.  [328] Erlenvein, No. 19, pp. 95-7.

[330] _Prashchurui._  [331] The sentence in italics is a good specimen of the _priskazka_, or preface.  [332] _Gramota_ = γράμματα whence comes _gràmotey_, able to read and write = γραμματικός.  [333] Vanya and Vanyusha are diminutives of Ivan (John), answering to our Johnny; Vanka is another, more like our Jack.  [334] Literally "with a Solovei-like whistle." The word _solovei_ generally means a nightingale, but it was also the name of a mythical hero, a robber whose voice or whistle had the power of killing those who heard it.  [335] _Chmoknuel_, smacked.  [336] See Barsof's rich collection of North-Russian funeral poetry, entitled "Prichitaniya Syevernago Kraya," Moscow, 1872.

[351] Afanasief, vi. No. 32. From the Novgorod Government. A "chap-book" version of this story will be found in Dietrich's collection (pp. 152-68 of the English translation); also in Keightley's "Tales and Popular Fictions."  [352] _Nijnie_, lower. Thus Nijny Novgorod is the lower (down the Volga) Novgorod. (Dahl.)  [353] _Kukova_, a stick or cudgel, one end of which is bent and rounded like a ball.  [354] _Tak de ego ne vzat'._  [355] There are numerous variants of this story among the Skazkas. In one of these (Afanasief, vii. No. 31) the man on whom the pike has bestowed supernatural power uses it to turn a Maiden princess into a mother. This renders the story wholly in accordance with (1) the Modern Greek tale of "The Half Man," (Hahn, No. 8) in which the magic formula runs, "according to the first word of God and the second of the fish shall such and such a thing be done!" (2) The Neapolitan story of "Pervonto" (Basile's "Pentamerone," No. 3) who obtains his magic power from three youths whom he screens from the sun as they lie asleep one hot day, and who turn out to be sons of a fairy. Afanasief compares the story also with the German tale of "The Little Grey Mannikin," in the "Zeitschrift für Deutsche Mythologie," &c., i. pp. 38-40. The incident of wishes being fulfilled by a fish occurs in many stories, as in that of "The Fisherman," in the "Arabian Nights," "The Fisherman and his Wife," in Grimm (_KM._, No. 19). A number of stories about the Pike are referred to by A. de Gubernatis ("Zoolog. Mythology," ii. 337-9).  [356] Quoted by Afanasief from Siemienski's "Podania," Posen, 1845, p. 42.  [357] "Songs of the Russian People," pp. 387-427.  [358] Afanasief, vii. No. 36 _a_. This story has no special title in the original.  [359] The rural police. _Sotnick_ = centurion, from _sto_ = 100. _Desyatnik_ is a word of the same kind from _desyat_ = 10.  [360] A Ponomar is a kind of sacristan.

[362] "Polnische Volkssagen" (translated by Lewestam), p. 61.  [363] Brockhaus's "Mährchensammlung des Somadeva Bhatta," ii. p. 24.  [364] Afanasief, vii. No. 36 _b_. This story, also, is without special title.  [365] In Mr. Hain Friswell's collection of "Ghost Stories," 1858.  [366] Afanasief, vii. No. 36 _c_. Also without special title.  [367] The Russian _skovoroda_ is a sort of stew-pan, of great size, without a handle.  [368] From Professor Brockhaus's summary in the "Berichte der phil. hist. Classe der Königl. Sächs. Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften," 1861, pp. 215, 16.  [369] For an account of this mythological bird, see the note on next page. Ornithologically, the _Zhar-ptitsa_ is the Cassowary.  [370] Khudyakof, No. 110. From the Nijegorod Government.  [371] _Zhar_ = glowing heat, as of a furnace; _zhar-ptitsa_ = the glow-bird. Its name among the Czekhs and Slovaks is _Ptak Ohnivák_. The heathens Slavonians are said to have worshipped Ogon or Agon, Fire, the counterpart of the Vedic Agni. _Agon_ is still the ordinary Russian word for fire, the equivalent of the Latin _ignis_.  [372] Afanasief, vii. No. 11. See also the notes in viii. p. 620, etc.  [373] Grimm's _KM._, No. 57. See the notes in Bd. iii. p. 98.  [374] Afanasief, vii. No. 12.  [375] Khudyakof, No. 104. From the Orel Government.  [376] The _kholodnaya izba_--the "cold izba," as opposed to the "warm izba" or living room.  [377] The etymology of the word _koldun_ is still, I believe, a moot point. The discovery of the money in the warlock's coffin seems an improbable incident. In the original version of the story the wizard may, perhaps, have turned into a heap of gold (see above, p. 231, on "Gold-men").  [378] Campbell, No. 13, vol. i. p. 215.     .
