  One day when he was out hunting the Count passed through a forest, and at the door of a lonely cottage he saw a beautiful girl spinning hemp.  ‘What is your name?’ he asked her.  ‘Renelde, my lord.’  ‘You must get tired of staying in such a lonely place?’  ‘I am accustomed to it, my lord, and I never get tired of it.’  ‘That may be so; but come to the castle, and I will make you lady’s maid to the Countess.’  ‘I cannot do that, my lord. I have to look after my grandmother, who is very helpless.’  ‘Come to the castle, I tell you. I shall expect you this evening,’ and he went on his way.  But Renelde, who was betrothed to a young wood-cutter called Guilbert, had no intention of obeying the Count, and she had, besides, to take care of her grandmother.  Three days later the Count again passed by.  ‘Why didn’t you come?’ he asked the pretty spinner.  ‘I told you, my lord, that I have to look after my grandmother.’  ‘Come to-morrow, and I will make you lady-in-waiting to the Countess,’ and he went on his way.  This offer produced no more effect than the other, and Renelde did not go to the castle.  ‘If you will only come,’ said the Count to her when next he rode by, ‘I will send away the Countess, and will marry you.’  But two years before, when Renelde’s mother was dying of a long illness, the Countess had not forgotten them, but had given help when they sorely needed it. So even if the Count had really wished to marry Renelde, she would always have refused.
