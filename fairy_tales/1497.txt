. Erdélyi, i. 2.   Cf. "The Secret-keeping Little Boy," p. 233, in this collection.  According to Ladislaus Arany,[54] an almost exact version of the tale is given in Schott's _Wallachische Märchen_ (No. 9). Schott calls attention to the resemblance of this tale to the story of Joseph, in the Old Testament, who is released from prison and exalted for the successful solution of dreams. See also two stories from Radloff, _Proben der Volkslitteratur der Türkischen Stämme Süd-Siberiens_, quoted in _Gubernatis_, vol. i. pp. 139-142.  The "Operencziás Tenger," is the mythical sea of Hungarian folk-tales. With regard to the etymology of the word, it is said by some to come from the expression "ober der Enns," in the German name of the Duchy of Upper Austria. The etymology is given for what it is worth. As to the cosmology of the story-tellers, all we can say is, that they appear to uphold the Zetetic school. The earth is flat, and surrounded by the Operenczian sea: beyond that is fairyland.  The Magyar peasants think much of dreams, as may be seen in their wonderful dream-book, "_A legrégibb és legnagyobb Egyiptomi Almoskönyv_," a work something in the same style as the dream-books that are still common in country places in England.  The significance of dreams is noticed in _Uarda_, cap. xv. Cf. _Denton_, "The Dream of the King's Son." _Horace_, c. _iii_. _xxvii_. 41; S. i. x. 33. _Homer_ says that dreams of falsehood passed through an ivory gate in the lower world: true ones through a gate of horn.  See also Tylor, _Early History of Mankind_, pp. 5-10; and _Primitive Culture_, "Dreams."  There are many stories of dreams which foretold wealth and power, or were the means of the dreamer attaining them, _e.g._ "Gontram the good King of Burgundy," Claud Paradin, _Symbola Heroica_. Also Chambers's _Book of Days_, vol. i. pp. 276, 394, 617; vol. ii. p. 188. The writer remembers hearing an almost precisely similar story to the last, when the ill-fated "Lifeguard" was lost on her way from Newcastle to London.  The Indians pay great attention to their dreams during the long fast at the beginning of manhood: see _Legends of the Wigwam_, p. 99. In some stories one of the chief characters pretends to dream that she may obtain certain information, such as "Luxhale's wives:" _Stories from the Land of Hofer_, p. 317.  It is a common superstition in Holderness that a morning dream is sure to come true, but if it is told to anyone before breakfast, it will not.  _Page 118_. "Immured alive": see a Magyar folk-song, "Clement the Mason," in the _Academy_, July 31, 1886. Cf. a paper read by Oscar Mailand before the Historical and Antiquarian Society of the County of Hunyad (April 29, 1885) on the legend of the building of the Monastery at Arges in Roumania. The story is nearly the same as in the song of "Clement the Mason." Manuli, the master builder, has a dream, wherein he is recommended to immure the first woman that appears on the scene; the victim is Manuli's wife. During the discussion that followed, the president, Count Géza Kuun, mentioned that the same tale is told of the castle of Dévén in the county of Nógrád; the fortress of Dévény near Pozsony (Pressburg); and of another fortress in the Trans-danubian division, and that the legend is of Slavonic origin.  _Grimm_, ii. "Maid Maleen," p. 350.  _Livius_, viii. c. 15, "Virgo Vestalis damnati incesti, viva deforsa est."  The king vows to slaughter thirty Muslims at the gate of his palace, when complete, in "Ali Noureddin." Payne's _Arabian Nights_, vol. viii. p. 141.  _Folk-Lore Journal_, 1880, p. 282; January 1883, "A Bewildering Superstition."  Cf. also the incident in "Secret-keeping Little Boy", p. 238.  "_Dog-Headed Tartars_." Our story-tellers almost invariably use the epithet "dog-headed" when speaking of their old enemies, the Tartars. Medieval travellers, who wrote in Latin, speak of the Great Khan of Tartary as "Magnus Canis." Cf. _The Travels of Friar Odoric_, in _Cathay and the way Thither_ (Hakluyt Soc. 1866). The learned editor remarks (p. 128, note): "I am not sure that a faithful version should not render 'Magnus Canis' as the 'Great Dog,' for in most copies the word is regularly declined 'Canis,' 'Cani,' 'Canem,' as if he were really a bow-wow. According to Ludolf, an old German translation of Mandeville does introduce the mighty prince as 'Der grosse Hund.'"  The irruption into Hungary of the Tartars under Batu Khan, in the thirteenth century, and their frightful slaughter and terrible devastations are sufficiently known, and need not further be enlarged upon here.  With regard to dog-headed people (cf. the Kynokephaloi of Ktesias), such people are often mentioned in ancient travels; thus, Odoric of Pordenone says: "[L'Isola che si chiama] Nichovera ... nella quale tutti gli nomini [h]anno il capo a modo d'un cane."
