 MIRKÓ. Kriza, xiii.   _Page 59_. In the Finnish "Leppäpölkky" ("Alder Block"), _S. ja T_. ii. p. 2, one half of the castle laughs and one half cries. The crying being on account of a great three-headed snake which arose from the sea, and would devour half the castle, half the men, and half the precious stones if the king did not give his eldest daughter in their stead.  _Page 63_. The Tátos is a mythic horse possessed of the most marvellous powers. It is generally represented (as in the present tale) as being a most wretched creature to begin with. Cf. "The Little Magic Pony," p. 157; "The Three Princes, &c.," p. 197, where it is hatched from a five-cornered black egg; "the wretched foal which lies seven fathoms deep in the dung-heap," in "The Pelican," p. 256; the ugly creature in "The Girl with the Golden Hair," p. 264; and the piebald in the "Fairies' Well," p. 289. It feeds on burning cinders, and its breath changes the most wretched things into the most glorious. Sometimes, however, the first breath has an extraordinary effect, as _e.g._ p. 198, where Ambrose becomes like "a diseased sucking pig." The name is still a favourite one among the peasants for their horses. The word Tátos also meant a priest in the old pagan days, but it never has this meaning in the folk-tales.   The Tátos also appears in "Die Königstöchter," in Mailáth's _Magyarische Sagen_, vol. i. p. 61. See also "Zauberhelene," vol. ii. of the same collection, where we are told "Taigarot war ein wunderbares Pferd; es verstand die Reden der Menschen, antwortete auch und hatte neun Füsze." The whole story tells how Argilus carries off his wife, Helen, from the power of Holofernes, the fire-king, who has got her in his underground home. Taigarot belongs to Holofernes, and tells him where Helen is carried off, and so he recovers her. Argilus hears that the magic horse has a younger brother still more powerful although possessing but four legs. This horse belongs to one Iron nose, a witch, and so Argilus enters her service in order to obtain it. His duties are, first to control the witch's stud of brazen horses; next to look after her twelve black mares, who are her daughters, and then to milk them, and make a bath of their milk. He manages to do all by means of a magic staff, and so obtains the horse; whilst the witch is burnt to death in the bath which she thinks will make her young. The horse tells Argilus to wash it in the bath, and it at once becomes the colour of gold, and from every hair hangs a golden bell. With this horse Argilus carries off his wife. Holofernes follows on Taigarot, and not being able to overtake them, digs his spurs into Taigarot, who in his indignation at such treatment kicks Holofernes off, and so breaks his neck.  For magic horses in other lands cf. the following tales:--the Finnish "Oriiksi Muntettu Poika;" "The Little White Horse" in "Ferdinand the Faithful," _Grimm_, ii. p. 156; Katar, in "The Bay with a Moon and Star," _Stokes_, p. 131, which becomes changed by twisting his right ear; "Weisnittle," in Stier's _Ungarische Volksmärchen_, p. 61; Sleipnir, Odin's eight-legged horse that used to carry the father of the gods as swift as the wind over land and sea, in Wagner's _Asgard and the Gods;_ and "Bayard, Faithful Bayard!" the good steed in the Carolingian Legends in Wagner's _Epics and Romances of the Middle Ages_, pp. 367-396; "the shaggy dun filly" in "The Young King of Easaidh Ruadh," in _Campbell's Tales of the Western Highlands_, vol. i. p. 4; and the "steed," in "The Rider of Grianaig," vol iii. p. 14 of the same book.  A magic horse appears in the Lapp story "Jætten og Veslegutten," (The Giant and the Vesle Boy), from Hammerfest; _Friis_, p. 48. In this case it assists the boy to escape from the giant, and to marry a king's daughter; and finally becomes a prince when its head is cut off. "A winged horse" appears in "Ivan, Kupiskas Søn," a story from Akkala, in Russian Finland; _Friis_, p. 170. In "Jætten Katten og Gutten" (the Giant, the Cat, and the Boy), from Alten, _Friis_, p. 63, the boy saves the giant's son from a troll cat, and is told by the lad he saves, that his father will offer him a gold horse and "a miserable one," and he is to be sure and choose the miserable one; and in like manner he was to choose a miserable box, and a miserable flute, in preference to golden ones, which would be offered to him. There is a somewhat similar Finnish story, "Paholaisen antamat Soittoneuwot" (Musical Instruments Given by the Devil), _S. ja T._, vol. i. p. 181, where the hero, when in the woods, sees the devil[22] running for his life, with a pack of wolves at his heels. The lad shoots into the pack, killing one wolf, and thus terrifying the rest. The grateful devil promises the lad whatever he wishes. Acting on the advice of a maid in the devil's house, he asks "for the mare which is in the third stall, on the right-hand side of the stable." The devil is very loath to give this, but is obliged to do so, and gives the boy a kantele, a fiddle, and a flute besides. The mare acts the part of a Tátos for part of the tale, and then changes into a woman, being the wife of the king, who appears at the latter part of the story, and who orders the hero to perform difficult tasks. The kantele is like the fiddle in the "Jew in a thicket" (_Musical Myths_, vol. ii. p. 122; _Grimm_, vol. ii. p. 97), it makes every one dance that hears it. The woman drops out of the story, and the persecuting king is kicked up into the clouds by the irate devil who comes to help the hero, and is never heard of again.  A horse that can talk plays a prominent part in another Finnish tale, "The Golden Bird."--"Dapplegrim" is the magic foal in the Norse; see _Dasent_, pp. 313 and 367. See also the "brown foal" in _Grimm_, "Two Brothers," No. 107, and the "white horse," in "Ferdinand the Faithful," No. 126, and _note_.  Note also horses in "Der goldne Vogel," "Das Zauberross," and "Der Knabe und der Schlange," in Haltrich's, _Siebenbuergische Märchen_; "La Belle aux cheveux d'or," in _Contes des Fées_, par Mme. D'Aulnoy; "Schönchen Goldhaar," _Märchensaal aller Völker für Jung und Alt_, Dr. Kletke, i. p. 344; "Der goldne Apfelbaum," in Kaiadschitsch, _Volksmärchen der Serben_, p. 33; and Denton, p. 43. Enchanted horses play a prominent part in "Simple Johnny," p. 36, and "The Black Charger of Hernando," p. 292, in _Patranas or Spanish Stories_.--Cf. "The little Mare" from Mentone, _F. L. Record_, vol. iii. p. 44. The Russians tell of "a sorry colt rolling in the muck," which possesses marvellous powers in "Marya Morevna," _Ralston_, p. 94; and in "Koshchei, the Deathless," there is an heroic steed, _ibidem_, p. 101. See also "Ivan Kruchina," _Naake_, p. 124. "The marvellous white horse" appears also in Austria; see _Land of Marvels_, pp. 48, 256, 260, 272, 342.  In the story of the third royal mendicant, in the _Arabian Nights_, Agib mounts a black horse and flies through the air. Similar incidents will be found in Nos. 1, 2, 4, 10, 17 of Dietrich's _Runische Volksmärchen_. Several variants, together with the author's view of their significance, are to be found in _Gubernatis_, vol. i., chap. ii.  The following, quoted from Stokes's _Fairy Tales_, p. 278, is worthy of notice:--  "On the morning of the day which was to see his last fight, Cúchulainn ordered his charioteer, Loeg, to harness the Gray to his chariot. 'I swear to God what my people swears' said Loeg, 'though the men of Conchobar's fifth (Ulster) were around the Gray of Macha, they could not bring him to the chariot.... If thou wilt, come thou, and speak with the Gray himself.' Cúchulainn went to him. And thrice did the horse turn his left side to his master.... Then Cúchulainn reproached his horse, saying that he was not wont to deal thus with his master. Thereat the Gray of Macha came and let his big round tears of blood fall on Cúchulainn's feet. The hero then leaps into his chariot and goes to battle. At last the Gray is sore wounded, and he and Cúchulainn bid each other farewell. The Gray leaves his master; but when Cúchulainn, wounded to death, has tied himself to a stone pillar to die standing, then came the Gray of Macha to Cúchulainn to protect him so long as his soul abode in him, and the 'hero's light' out of his forehead remained. Then the Gray of Macha wrought the three red routs all around him. And fifty fell by his teeth and thirty by each of his hooves. This is what he slew of the host. And hence is (the saying) 'Not keener were the victorious courses of the Gray of Macha after Cúchulainn's slaughter.' Then Lugaid and his men cut off the hero's head and right hand and set off, driving the Gray before them. They met Conall the Victorious, who knew what had happened when he saw his friend's horse. And he and the Gray of Macha sought Cúchulainn at the pillar-stone. Then went the Gray of Macha and laid his head on Cúchulainn's breast. And Conall said, 'A heavy care to the Gray of Macha is that corpse.' Conall himself, in the fight he has with Lugaid, to avenge his friend's slaughter, is helped by his own horse, the Dewy-Red. When Conall found that he prevailed not, he saw his steed, the Dewy-Red, by Lugaid. And the steed came to Lugaid and tore a piece out of his side."  ("Cúchulainn's Death," abridged from the "Book of Leinster," in _Revue Celtique_, Juin, 1877, pp. 175, 176, 180, 182, 183, 185).  See also, Grimm's _Teutonic Mythology_, Stallybrass, vol. i. pp. 328, 392; McGregor's _Folk-Lore of the North-East of Scotland_, p. 131; and Belludo, the goblin horse of Alhambra. Nor must we forget "Phooka," the wild horse of Erin's isle.  Note also the "Iliad"; cf. book ii. 760, book viii. 157, book x. 338, 473; specially Xanthus and Balius who talk, book xix. 440; and, Martial's splendid epigram, beginning "Phosphore redde diem, cur gaudia nostra moraris?"  Thus on every side we find this noble creature entwined in the lore of the people, from the peasants' dull superstition to great Milton's song,--      "Of the wondrous horse of brass,     On which the Tartar king did ride."   The horse still plays an important part in the folk-lore. Thus _e.g._ Yorkshire people say, that if you see a piebald horse, and do not look at his tail, or think of a fox, whatever you wish for will be granted; also, that you must spit over your finger for luck when you see a white horse. The four black horses and chariot still rush through Penzance streets in the night, according to some, and the white horse is carried by the Christmas mummers in various parts of England and Germany. In the Midlands a horse's head and skin is dragged about on Christmas eve; a simulacrum, as some think, of Odin's heroic steed. Cf. _Henderson_, p. 70, also F. Finn and Magyar Songs on St. Stephen's Day. _Academy_ 1884. pp. 150, 315.  _Page 63_. For breathing on old things and causing them to change, see p. 92, where the baa-lambs restore the lad's body by blowing; and a Finnish tale tells how a snake commands the hero to create with his clean breath a copper battlefield that they may fight, and is told by the man to create an iron one with his heathen breath, which he does; and other snakes come in the story who in turn create copper and silver battlefields, see Leppäpölkky, _S. ja T._ 2.  Sometimes the change is effected by a bath, as in "Fairy Elizabeth," p. 110, _supra_.  Cf. _Grimm_, "Iron John," vol. ii. p. 195.  _Page 65._ A glass mountain appears in the "Iron Stove," _Grimm_, vol. ii. p. 161; "the princess on the glass mountain" in Thorpe's _Yule-Tide Stories_, p.86; and "The crystal mountain" in _Vernaleken_ p. 276. It occurs also in a Lincolnshire story, where the forsaken wife sits at her husband's door and sings:      "Bare bull of orange return to me,     For three fine babes I bore to thee,     And climbed a glass hill for thee,     Bare bull of orange return to me."                       _Folk-Lore Journal_, 1885, p. 188.[23]   See also notes to "The Little Magic Pony," _infra_.  The giant in "Handsome Paul," p. 26, like the Tátos in the present tale, tells his friend to shut his eyes and open them at intervals on account of the great speed they are going at; just as in the Finnish "Golden Bird," the young man on the wolf's back is obliged to rub his eyes with his handkerchief because the pace they are going at makes them water. In the hurry he drops it and asks the wolf to stop a minute to pick it up and is told it is already 1,000 miles behind them.  _Page 66._ Knight Mezey's wonderful sword is one of a numberless group of incidents wherein the sword plays an important part; in this story Mirkó ordered out his magic sword to protect him while he slept, and then to join with Knight Mezey's in mowing down the enemies. When he met Doghead (p. 73), their swords in like manner flew out of the scabbards and fought their masters' battles; and in the "Secret-keeping little Boy," p. 233, in this collection, the hero is born with a scabbard at his side, whilst a sword point appeared in the garden and grew as the scabbard grew; this sword cut up into pulp any one who came near its master on mischief bent. Alderblock's sword in the Finnish story in like manner flew out and cut Syöjätär into mincemeat. The Greeks told of "Harpé," the sword Hermes lent to Perseus, and of the honoured swords of Ulysses and Achilles.  Norse legends tell of wondrous swords, such as Odin's "Gram" that he drove into an ash tree there to remain till the man should be found strong enough to draw it out.[24] Cheru's sword, forged by the dwarfs, "shone every morning on the high place of the sanctuary, sending forth its light afar when dawn arose like a flame of fire;" then there is Heimdal, born of nine mothers, the sword "Ase" of the Edda, who with his mighty sword made even cunning Loki cry for mercy.  In the Niebelungen there is "Balmung," craftily made by the dwarfs and tempered in dragons' blood, wherewith Siegfried smote the giants, and did mighty wonders, yea, even after its master's death slaying his enemies, till at last it rested on his grave by Brunhild's side. Roland wielded his good sword "Durindart," the gift of an angel, against the Paynim foe and did great wonders.  Dietrich in terrible conflict won "Eche-sax": Flammberg and the good horse Bayard wrought wonders in the days of Haymon and his children: Hunford's token of reconciliation to Beowulf, was the gift of "Hrunting" hardened in dragon's blood: Nägling, Nagelring, and Rosen, too, smote their worms, whilst "Mimung," good trusty Mimung, in the hands of heroes, did mighty wonders, even splitting asunder a floating pack of wool; and was so keen that Amilias did not know that Mimung had cut him in two till he shook himself; and lo! he fell into two pieces. Wayland Smith laboured in our own land, and brought forth a wondrous sword.      "Bitterfer, the sword hight,     Better swerde bar never knight.       Horn, to thee ich it thought,      Is nought a knight in Inglond     Schal sitten a dint of thine hand;     Forsake thou it nought."   Charlemagne had his "Joyeuse"; Roland his "Durendal"; Arthur his "Excalibur"--      "All the haft twinkled with diamond sparks,     Myriads of topaz-lights, and jacinth work     Of subtlest jewellery."   A wondrous thing that "rose up out of the bosom of the lake," held by an arm "clothed in white samite, mystic and wonderful;" and when the sword was thrown back to the lake (its master's life being well nigh run) by the bold Sir Bedivere--                                 "behold an arm     Clothed in white samite, mystic and wonderful,     That caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him     Three times, and drew him under in the mere."   Cf. Wagner's _Epics and Romance; Asgard and the Gods; Morte d'Arthur_, book 1, cap. xxiii. and book 21, cap. v.; _Mythical and Mediæval Swords_, by Lady Verney, in _Contemporary Review_, October, 1880; _The Seven Champions of Christendom;_ and Payne's _Arabian Nights_, vol. xi. pp. 129, 164.  In the Finnish "Oriiksi muutettu poika," the devil has a wonderful sword, which the hero obtains by the help of the horse: see also "The Water Smith," Keightley's _Fairy Mythology_, p. 260.--"Shortshanks," in _Dasent_, p. 153, gets possession of the only eye an old hag had, and so obtained "a sword, such a sword! It would put a whole army to flight, be it ever so great;" and certainly it chopped up sundry ogres later on in the tale; cf. p. 188 in the same collection.  The trap-door by which Mirkó entered the nether world appears in many stories, such as "St. Patrick's Purgatory"; see Baring Gould's _Curious Myths_, p. 230, and note to "Shepherd Paul" in this collection, _infra_.  _Page 68._ In the Lapp stories it is said that if Stallo's[25] dog is not killed as well as the monster himself, that it will lick its master's blood and then Stallo will come to life again, just as the witch in this story is evolved out of the morsels of unburnt ribs. See "Stallo" and "Fogden i Vadsø, som gjorde sig til en Stallo," in _Friis_, pp. 74, 97.  _Page 71._ The flashing eyes of the princess remind us of the Gorgons. Her repentance is like that of the queen in the Russian story, who slays and restores the hero; _Ralston_, p. 235.  The "strength-giving fluid" occurs in numerous stories, _e.g._, in the Finnish stories, "Alder Block," _S. ja T._, ii., p. 2, and the "Enchanted Horse," where the hero cannot move an immense sword until he wets his head with the blood that is in a tub in the middle of the forbidden room in the devil's house. Cf. also _Ralston_, p. 237; _Dasent_, "The big bird Dan," pp. 445, 459; _Folk-Lore Record_, 1879, p. 99; and, "Irish Folk-Tales," _ibidem_, 1883, p. 55.  Sometimes it is a belt or ointment that gives strength, as in "The Blue Belt" and "The Three Princesses of Whiteland," in _Dasent_, pp. 178, 209. Cf. _ante_, p. 248.  A daughter explains to the hero how to conquer her father, in Brockhaus, _Märchensammlung des Somadeva Bhatta_, vol. i., p. 110.  _Page 72._ In the Karelian story "Awaimetoin Wakka," _S. ja T._ i., p. 151, the lad threw a great iron pole against Vääräpyärä's castle, in order to let the inmates know he was coming. In the Finnish "Alder Block," _S. ja T._ ii. p. 2, the hero throws or kicks off one of his shoes, and it flies to his comrades, and they come and help him.  In "The History of Gherib and his brother Agib," Terkenan threw an iron mace at his son with such power that it smote three stones out of a buttress of the palace; Payne's _Arabian Nights_, vol. vi., p. 152. See also "Story of Vasilisa" in Naake's _Slavonic Tales_, p. 57; and "Sir Peppercorn," in Denton's _Serbian Folk-Lore_, p. 128: where Peppercorn hurls the giant's mace back to him just as Mirkó did; and _Roumanian Fairy Tales_, p. 64.  As to the name "Doghead," see Notes to "The Three Dreams," _infra_, p. 377.  _Page 74._ The castle that collapses into an apple also appears in "The Three Princes," p. 206, in this collection.  For a variant of Knight Mezey cf. "Zöldike," a Magyar tale, in _Gaal_, vol. iii., in which the beautiful meadow, the tent, the sleeping knight, and the witch weaving soldiers, all occur.
