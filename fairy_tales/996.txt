]  The girl could scarcely believe her ears, but the princess was already unfastening her beautiful silk dress, and taking off her silk stockings and pretty red shoes; and the goose girl lost no time in slipping out of her rough linen skirt and tunic. Then the princess put on the other's rags and let down her hair, and went to the kitchen to ask for a place.  'Do you want a kitchen-maid?' she said.  'Yes, we do,' answered the cook, who was too busy to ask the new-comer many questions.  The following day, after a good night's rest, the princess set about her new duties. The other servants were speaking of their master, and saying to each other how ill he was, and that unless he could be cured within three days he would surely die.  The princess thought of the snakes, and the bird's advice, and lifting her head from the pots and pans she was scouring, she said: 'I know how to make a soup that has such a wonderful power that whoever tastes it is sure to be cured, whatever his illness may be. As the doctors cannot cure your master shall I try?'  At first they all laughed at her.  'What! a scullion cure the knight when the best physicians in the kingdom have failed?'  But at last, just because all the physicians _had_ failed, they decided that it would do no harm to try; and she ran off joyfully to fetch her basket of snakes and make them into broth. When this was ready she carried some to the knight's room and entered it boldly, pushing aside all the learned doctors who stood beside his bed. The poor knight was too ill to know her, besides, she was so ragged and dirty that he would not have been likely to do so had he been well; but when he had taken the soup he was so much better that he was able to sit up.  The next day he had some more, and then he was able to dress himself.  'That is certainly wonderful soup!' said the cook.  The third day, after he had eaten his soup, the knight was quite well again.  'Who are you?' he asked the girl; 'was it you who made this soup that has cured me?'  'Yes,' answered the princess.  'Choose, then, whatever you wish as a reward,' said the knight, 'and you shall have it.'  'I would be your bride!' said the princess.  The knight frowned in surprise at such boldness, and shook his head.  'That is the one thing I cannot grant,' he said, 'for I am pledged to marry the most beautiful princess in the world. Choose again.'  Then the princess ran away and washed herself and mended her rags, and when she returned the Green Knight recognised her at once.  You can think what a joyful meeting that was!         *       *       *       *       *  Soon after, they were married with great splendour. All the knights and princes in the kingdom were summoned to the wedding, and the princess wore a dress that shone like the sun, so that no one had ever beheld a more gorgeous sight. The princess's father, of course, was present, but the wicked queen and her daughter were driven out of the country, and as nobody has seen them since, very likely they were eaten by wild beasts in the forest. But the bride and bridegroom were so happy that they forgot all about them, and they lived with the old king till he died, when they succeeded him.
