" (_p._ 182).]  "Nobody ever taught you to use your fingers usefully?" replied the old woman. "Go on moving them, still moving them, but in some employment that interests you. Don't let my fairies go to sleep--that is all they desire in their imprisonment."  On returning home, Rosebelle drew her long-neglected harp from its case and played on it. Then, to occupy her fingers more usefully, she had needles brought to her and employed them in dainty sewing.  But, growing weary of the dull monotony of these labours, she sought more varied employment for her fingers--gathered flowers in the garden and arranged them in charming bouquets; plucked fruit from the trees in the orchard; attended to the sick and ailing; consoled the poor--exercising her fingers constantly by slipping gold pieces into their grateful hands.  One by one, she sent away her crowd of obsequious servants, who had now nothing left for them to do but to go to sleep at their posts.  She would not allow anybody to do anything for her which she could do for herself, but threw her whole soul and being into the things God intended to be done by them.  Every day, and all the while the sun shone in the sky, she found active employment for her beautiful fingers. And the roses came back to her cheeks and health to all her being, and songs and laughter to her lips; and she could, once again, give to her beloved one a heart filled with ineffable tenderness.  Perfectly cured, she went to the sorceress and gave her back her wonderful little fairy doctors.  "Ah, my child!" said the old dame, "they are very proud of having saved you. Give them to me, for I have every day great need of them--can never have too much of them. Indeed, if I had enough of them to serve all the idlers in the world, I should want as many as there are stars in the heavens at night. But I will keep those I have for the service of those who are pining from _ennui_--and there are enough of _them_, goodness knows!"
