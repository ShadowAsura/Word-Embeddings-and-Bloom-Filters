.]  And laughing, dancing, and singing, the old, old woman tapped with the crooked thumb of her right hand the young Princess's ten extended fingers, while the quaint song she sang was gaily given back by the echo of the rocky vault above her. This was the song she sang, holding the Princess's delicate fingers caressingly in her left hand:--      "Ten good little fairies hie,     To these ten good fingers nigh:     Each of you reside in one     Until your kindly task is done,     Until by certain signs you're sure     That you have made a perfect cure.     Potent fairies, from this hour     Exercise your utmost pow'r;     Drive away the evil spell     Cast on one who'll love you well!"  Then, still laughing heartily, she pressed Rosebelle's fingers tightly, and went on:  "They are all here, the wonderful little doctors! Guard them preciously; do not weary them; keep them by you and, to do all that, never give them a moment's rest so long as the sun shines in the sky. Keep on moving them--actively, rapidly--so long as you are awake. Now go, and come back to me when you are quite cured, returning me my trusty little fairies."  With her hands filled with this precious load, Rosebelle hurried home, and told Greatheart of her dear hope of a renewal of life.  Of an evening, thenceforth, for a long time, she would even refrain from eating, so as to leave herself more time to exercise her unresting fingers, in which the ten little fairies were tenderly housed. As soon as the sun had sunk beneath the earth she went to sleep, and as soon as daylight returned, she at once rose and began once again to move her fairy-laden fingers.  During many, many days she continued to move her fingers in every way she could devise; but at length, growing tired of this useless play, she went back to her old friend the sorceress.
