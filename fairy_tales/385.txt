. 301.  [116] _Bog prostit_ = God will forgive. This sounds to the English ear like an ungracious reply, but it is the phrase ordinarily used by a superior when an inferior asks his pardon. Before taking the sacrament at Easter, the servants in a Russian household ask their employers to forgive them for any faults of which they may have been guilty. "God will forgive," is the proper reply.  [117] Khudyakof, No. 43.  [118] _Vikhor'_ (_vit'_ = to whirl), an agent often introduced for the purpose of abduction. The sorcerers of the present day are supposed to be able to direct whirlwinds, and a not uncommon form of imprecation in some parts of Russia is "May the whirlwind carry thee off!" See Afanasief, _P.V.S._ i. 317, and "Songs of the Russian People," p. 382.  [119] This story is very like that of the "Rider of Grianaig," "Tales of the West Highlands," iii. No. 58.  [120] Cf.

It is rendered by _Drache_ in the German translation of his collection of tales made by his daughter, but the word is evidently akin to the Sanskrit _ahi_, the Greek ἐχιρ ἐχιδνα, the Latin _anguis_, the Russian _ujak_, the Luthanian _angis_, etc. The Servian word _snaga_ answers to the Russian _sila_, strength.

For other versions of the story of the Giant's heart, or Koshchei's death, see Professor R. Köhler's remarks on the subject in "Orient und Occident," ii. pp. 99-103. A singular parallel to part of the Egyptian myth is offered by the Hottentot story in which the heart of a girl whom a lion has killed and eaten, is extracted from the lion, and placed in a calabash filled with milk. "The calabash increased in size, and in proportion to this, the girl grew again inside it." Bleek's "Reynard the Fox in South Africa," p. 55. Cf. Radloff, i. 75; ii. 237-8, 532-3.

[145] _Opokhmyelit'sya_, which may be rendered, "in order to drink off the effects of the debauch."  [146] The Russian bath somewhat resembles the Turkish. The word here translated "to scrub," properly means to rub and flog with the soft twig used in the baths for that purpose. At the end of the ceremonies attended on a Russian peasant wedding, the young couple always go to the bath.  [147] A sort of pudding or jelly.  [148] Afanasief, v. No. 28. In the preceding story, No. 27, the king makes no promise. He hides his children in (or upon) a pillar, hoping to conceal them from a devouring bear, whose fur is of iron. The bear finds them and carries them off. A horse and some geese vainly attempt their rescue; a bull-calf succeeds, as in the former case. In another variant the enemy is an iron wolf. A king had promised his children a wolf. Unable to find a live one, he had one made of iron and gave it to his children. After a time it came to life and began destroying all it found, etc. An interesting explanation of the stories of this class in which they are treated as nature-myths, is given by A. de Gubernatis in his "Zoological Mythology," chap. i. sect. 4.  [149] Khudyakof, No. 17.  [150] It has already been observed that the word _chudo_, which now means a marvel or prodigy, formerly meant a giant.  [151] Erlenvein, No. 6, pp. 30-32. The Russian word _idol_ is identical with our own adaptation of ειδωλου.  [152] Khudyakof, No. 18.

Compare with the conduct of the Cobra's daughter that of Angaraka, the daughter of the Daitya who, under the form of a wild boar, is chased underground by Chandasena.

[160] Afanasief says (_P.V.S._ iii. 588), "As regards the word _yaga_ (_yega_, Polish _jedza_, _jadza_, _jedzi-baba_, Slovak, _jenzi_, _jenzi_, _jezi-baba_, Bohemian, _jezinka_, Galician _yazya_) it answers to the Sanskrit _ahi_ = snake."  Shchepkin (in his work on "Russian Fable-lore," p. 109) says: "_Yaga_, instead of _yagaya_, means properly noisy, scolding, and must be connected with the root _yagat'_ = to brawl, to scold, still preserved in Siberia. The accuracy of this etymology is confirmed by the use, in the speech of the common people, of the designation _Yaga Baba_ for a quarrelsome, scolding old woman."  Kastorsky, in his "Slavonic Mythology," p. 138, starts a theory of his own. "The name _Yaga Baba_, I take to be _yakaya baba_, _nycyakaya baba_, and I render it by _anus quædam_." Bulgarin (Rossiya, ii. 322) refers the name to a Finnish root. According to him, "_Jagga-lema_, in Esthonian, means to quarrel or brawl, _jagga-lemine_ means quarrelling or brawling." There is some similarity between the Russian form of the word, and the Singalese name for a (male) demon, _yaka_, which is derived from the Pali _yakkho_, as is the synonymous term _yakseya_ from the Sanskrit _yaksha_ (see the valuable paper on Demonology in Ceylon by Dandris de Silva Gooneratne Modliar in the "Journal of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society," 1865-6). Some Slavonic philologists derive _yaga_ from a root meaning to eat (in Russian _yest'_). This corresponds with the derivation of the word _yaksha_ contained in the following legend: "The Vishnu Purāna, i. 5, narrates that they (the Yakshas) were produced by Brahmā as beings emaciate with hunger, of hideous aspect, and with long beards, and that, crying out 'Let us eat,' they were denominated Yakshas (fr. _jaksh_, to eat)." Monier Williams's "Sanskrit Dictionary," p. 801. In character the Yaga often resembles a Rákshasí.  [161] Afanasief, i. No. 3 b. From the Voroneje Government.  [162] Khudyakof, No. 60.

Their supernatural foe is a small gnome with a very long beard. He closely resembles the German "Erdmänneken" (Grimm, No. 91), and the "Männchen," in "Der starke Hans" (Grimm, No. 166.)

[193] I break off the narrative at this point, because what follows is inferior in dramatic interest, and I am afraid of diminishing the reader's admiration for one of the best folk-tales I know. But I give an epitome of the remainder within brackets and in small type.  [194] From the Poltava Government. Afanasief, vi. No. 28 _b_.  [195] Grimm, No. 65. The Wallachian and Lithuanian forms resemble the German (Schott, No. 3. Schleicher, No. 7). In all of them, the heroine is a princess, who runs away from an unnatural father. In one of the Modern Greek versions (Hahn, No. 27), she sinks into the earth. For references to seven other forms of the story, see Grimm, _KM._, iii. p. 116. In one Russian variant (Khudyakof, No. 54), she hides in a secret drawer, constructed for the purpose in a bedstead; in another (Afanasief, vi. No. 28 _a_), her father, not recognising her in the pig-skin dress, spits at her, and turns her out of the house. In a third, which is of a very repulsive character (ibid. vii. No. 29), the father kills his daughter.  [196] Afanasief, vi. No. 18.  [197] The Russian word is _zakukovali_, _i.e._, "They began to cuckoo." The resemblance between the word _kukla_, a puppet, and the name and cry of the cuckoo (_Kukushka_) may be merely accidental, but that bird has a marked mythological character. See the account of the rite called "the Christening of the Cuckoos," in "Songs of the Russian people," p. 215.  [198] Very like these puppets are the images which reply for the sleeping prince in the opening scene of "De beiden Künigeskinner" (Grimm, No. 113). A doll plays an important part in one of Straparola's stories (Night v. Fable 2). Professor de Gubernatis identifies the Russian puppet with "the moon, the Vedic Râkâ, very small, but very intelligent, enclosed in the wooden dress, in the forest of night," "Zoological Mythology," i. 207-8.

[203] The germ of all these repulsive stories about incestuous unions, proposed but not carried out, was probably a nature myth akin to that alluded to in the passage of the Rigveda containing the dialogue between Yama and Yami--"where she (the night) implores her brother (the day) to make her his wife, and where he declines her offer because, as he says, 'they have called it sin that a brother should marry his sister.'" Max Müller, "Lectures," sixth edition, ii. 557.  [204] Afanasief, vii. No. 18.  [205] Her name _Vyed'ma_ comes from a Slavonic root _véd_, answering to the Sanskrit _vid_--from which springs an immense family of words having reference to knowledge. _Vyed'ma_ and _witch_ are in fact cousins who, though very distantly related, closely resemble each other both in appearance and in character.  [206] Afanasief, i. No. 4 _a_. From the Voroneje Government.  [207] Ivashko and Ivashechko, are caressing diminutives of Ivan.  [208] "Some storytellers," says Afanasief, "substitute the word snake (_zmei_) in the Skazka for that of witch (_vyed'ma_)."  [209] Diminutive of Elena.  [210] _Gusi--lebedi_, geese--swans.

[215] The demonism of Ceylon "represents demons as having _human_ fathers and mothers, and as being born in the ordinary course of nature.

[218] Vertodub, the Tree-extractor (_vertyet'_ = to twirl, _dub_ = tree or oak) is the German _Baumdreher_ or _Holzkrummacher_; _Vertogor_ the Mountain leveller (_gora_ = mountain) answers to the _Steinzerreiber_ or _Felsenkripperer_.  [219] Why are you just now so _zaplakannoi_ or blubbered. (_Zalplakat'_, or _plakat'_ = to cry.)  [220] _Otkuda ni vzyalis._  [221] _Vidimo--nevidimo_, visibly--invisibly.  [222] _Zashumyeli_, they began to produce a _shum_ or noise.  [223] Afanasief, _P.V.S._, i. 80-84. In the Albanian story of "The Serpent Child," (Hahn, No. 100), the heroine, the wife of the man whom forty snake-sloughs encase, is assisted in her troubles by two subterranean beings whom she finds employed in baking. They use their hands instead of shovels, and clean out the oven with their breasts. They are called "Sisters of the Sun."     .
