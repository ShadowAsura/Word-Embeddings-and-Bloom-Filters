 he had quite finished his bath, and as he left the bathroom he cried:  ‘Two into the sack.’  And the two crept back at once into the sack.  Then the man took both sacks, the good and the bad one, and went away home.  When he was near the house he shouted: ‘Hallo, old woman, come and meet me!’  His wife only screamed out:  ‘You broomstick, come here! Your back shall pay for this.’  The man went into the cottage, hung his sack on a nail, and said, as the crane had taught him:  ‘Two out of the sack.’  Instantly two pretty lads sprang out of the sack, brought in oak tables, laid silken covers on them, and spread them with all sorts of delicious dishes and refreshing drinks.  The woman ate and drank, and praised her husband.  ‘Well, now, old man, I won’t beat you any more,’ said she.  When they had done eating, the man carried off the good sack, and put it away in his store-room, but hung the bad sack up on the nail. Then he lounged up and down in the yard.  Meantime his wife became thirsty. She looked with longing eyes at the sack, and at last she said, as her husband had done:  ‘Two out of the sack.’  And at once the two rogues with their big sticks crept out of the sack, and began to belabour her as they sang:            ‘Would you beat your husband true?                  Don’t cry so!                     Now we’ll beat you black and blue!                          Oh!  Oh!’  The woman screamed out: ‘Old man, old man! Come here, quick! Here are two ruffians pommelling me fit to break my bones.’  Her husband only strolled up and down and laughed, as he said: ‘Yes, they’ll beat you well, old lady.’  And the two thumped away and sang again:            ‘Blows will hurt, remember, crone,                 We mean you well, we mean you well;                     In future leave the stick alone,                            For how it hurts, you now can tell,                                 One--two--’  At last her husband took pity on her, and cried:  ‘Two into the sack.’  He had hardly said the words before they were back in the sack again.  From this time the man and his wife lived so happily together that it was a pleasure to see them, and so the story has an end.  (From Russiche Marchen.)
