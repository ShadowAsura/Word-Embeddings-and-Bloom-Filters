.   Most of the magical "properties" of the "skazka-drama," closely resemble those which have already been rendered familiar to us by well-known folk-tales. Of such as these--of "caps of darkness," of "seven-leagued boots," of "magic cudgels," of "Fortunatus's purses," and the like[296]--it is unnecessary, for the present, to say more than that they are of as common occurrence in Slavonic as in other stories. But there are some among them which materially differ from their counterparts in more western lands, and are therefore worthy of special notice. To the latter class belong the Dolls of which mention has already been made, and the Waters of Life and Death of which I am now about to speak.  A Water of Life plays an important part in the folk-tales of every land.[297] When the hero of a "fairy story" has been done to death by evil hands, his resuscitation by means of a healing and vivifying lotion or ointment[298] follows almost as a matter of course. And by common consent the Raven (or some sort of crow) is supposed to know where this invaluable specific is to be found,[299] a knowledge which it shares with various supernatural beings as well as with some human adepts in magic, and sometimes with the Snake. In all these matters the Russian and the Western tales agree, but the Skazka differs from most stories of its kind in this respect, that it almost invariably speaks of _two_ kinds of magic waters as being employed for the restoration of life. We have already seen in the story of "Marya Morevna," that one of these, sometimes called the _mertvaya voda_--the "dead water," or "Water of Death"--when sprinkled over a mutilated corpse, heals all its wounds; while the other, which bears the name of the _zhivaya voda_,--the "living water," or "Water of Life"--endows it once more with vitality.        [In a Norse tale in Asbjörnsen's new series, No. 72,       mention is made of a Water of Death, as opposed to a       Water of Life. The Death Water (_Doasens Vana_) throws       all whom it touches into a magic sleep, from which       only Life Water (_Livsens Vand_) can rouse them (p.       57). In the Rámáyana, Hanuman fetches four different       kinds of herbs in order to resuscitate his dead       monkeys: "the first restore the dead to life, the       second drive away all pain, the third join broken       parts, the fourth cure all wounds, &c." Talboys       Wheeler, "History of India," ii. 368. In the Egyptian       story already mentioned (at p. 113), Satou's corpse       quivers and opens its eyes when his heart has become       saturated with a healing liquid. But he does not       actually come to life till the remainder of the liquid       has been poured down his throat.        In a Kirghiz story, quoted by Bronevsky,[300] a       golden-haired hero finds, after long search, the       maiden to whom he had in very early life been       betrothed. Her father has him murdered. She persuades       the murderer to show her the body of her dead love,       and weeps over it bitterly. A spirit appears and tells       her to sprinkle it with water from a neighboring well.       The well is very deep, but she induces the murderer to       allow her to lower him into it by means of her       remarkably long hair. He descends and hands up to her       a cup of water. Having received it, she cuts off her       hair, and lets the murderer drop and be drowned. Then       she sprinkles her lover's corpse with the water, and       he revives. But he lives only three days. She refuses       to survive him, and is buried by his side. From the       graves of the lovers spring two willows, which mingle       their boughs as if in an embrace. And the neighbors       set up near the spot three statues, his and hers and       her nurse's.        Such is the story, says Bronevsky, which the Kirghiz       tell with respect to some statues of unknown origin       which stand (or used to stand) near the Ayaguza, a       river falling into Lake Balkhash. A somewhat similar       Armenian story is quoted by Haxthausen in his       Transcaucasia (p. 350 of the English translation).        In the Kalevala, when Lemmenkäinen has been torn to       pieces, his mother collects his scattered remains, and       by a dexterous synthetical operation restores him to       physical unity. But the silence of death still       possesses him. Then she entreats the Bee to bring       vivifying honey. After two fruitless journeys, the Bee       succeeds in bringing back honey "from the cellar of       the Creator." When this has been applied, the dead man       returns to life, sits up, and says in the words of the       Russian heroes--"How long I have slept!"[301]        Here is another instance of a life-giving operation       of a double nature. There is a well-known Indian story       about four suitors for the hand of one girl. She dies,       but is restored to life by one of her lovers, who       happens one day to see a dead child resuscitated, and       learns how to perform similar miracles. In two       Sanskrit versions of the "Vetálapanchavinsati,"[302]       as well as in the Hindi version,[303] the life-giving       charm consists in a spell taken from a book of magic.       But in the Tamil version, the process is described as       being of a different and double nature. According to       it, the mother of the murdered child "by the charm       called _sisupàbam_ re-created the body, and, by the       incantation called _sanjìvi_, restored it to life."       The suitor, having learnt the charm and the       incantation, "took the bones and the ashes (of the       dead girl), and having created out of them the body,       by virtue of the charm _sisupàbam_ gave life to that       body by the _sanjìvi_ incantation." According to Mr.       Babington, "Sanjìvi is defined by the Tamuls to be a       medicine which restores to life by dissipating a       mortal swoon.... In the text the word is used for the       art of using this medicine."[304]]  As a general rule, the two waters of which mention is made in the Skazkas possess the virtues, and are employed in the manner, mentioned above; but there are cases in which their powers are of a different nature. Sometimes we meet with two magic fluids, one of which heals all wounds, and restores sight to the blind and vigor to the cripple, while the other destroys all that it touches. Sometimes, also, recourse is had to magic draughts of two kinds, the one of which strengthens him who quaffs it, while the other produces the opposite effect. Such liquors as these are known as the "Waters of Strength and Weakness," and are usually described as being stowed away in the cellar of some many-headed Snake. For the Snake is often mentioned as the possessor, or at least the guardian, of magic fluids. Thus one of the Skazkas[305] speaks of a wondrous garden, in which are two springs of healing and vivifying water, and around that garden is coiled like a ring a mighty serpent. Another tells how a flying Snake brought two heroes to a lake, into which they flung a green bough, and immediately the bough broke into flame and was consumed. Then it took them to another lake, into which they cast a mouldy log. And the log straightway began to put forth buds and blossoms.[306]  In some cases the magic waters are the property, not of a Snake, but of one of the mighty heroines who so often occur in these stories, and who bear so great a resemblance to Brynhild, as well in other respects as in that of her enchanted sleep. Thus in one of the Skazkas[307] an aged king dreams that "beyond thrice nine lands, in the thirtieth country, there is a fair maiden from whose hands and feet water is flowing, of which water he who drinks will become thirty years younger." His sons go forth in search of this youth-giving liquid, and, after many adventures, the youngest is directed to the golden castle in which lives the "fair maiden," whom his father has seen in his vision. He has been told that when she is awake her custom is to divert herself in the green fields with her Amazon host--"for nine days she rambles about, and then for nine days she sleeps a heroic slumber." The Prince hides himself among the bushes near the castle, and sees a fair maiden come out of it surrounded by an armed band, "and all the band consists of maidens, each one more beautiful than the other. And the most beautiful, the most never-enough-to-be-gazed-upon, is the Queen herself." For nine days he watches the fair band of Amazons as they ramble about. On the tenth day all is still, and he enters the castle. In the midst of her slumbering guards sleeps the Queen on a couch of down, the healing water flowing from her hands and feet. With it he fills two flasks, and then he retires. When the Queen awakes, she becomes conscious of the theft and pursues the Prince. Coming up with him, she slays him with a single blow, but then takes compassion on him, and restores him to life.  In another version of the story, the precious fluid is contained in a flask which is hidden under the pillow of the slumbering "Tsar Maiden." The Prince steals it and flees, but he bears on him the weight of sin, and so, when he tries to clear the fence which girds the enchanted castle, his horse strikes one of the cords attached to it, and the spell is broken which maintains the magic sleep in which the realm is locked. The Tsar Maiden pursues the thief, but does not succeed in catching him. He is killed, however, by his elder brothers, who "cut him into small pieces," and then take the flask of magic water to their father. The murdered prince is resuscitated by the mythical bird known by the name of the _Zhar-Ptitsa_, which collects his scattered fragments, puts them together, and sprinkles them first with "dead water" and then with "live-water,"--conveyed for that purpose in its beak--after which the prince gets up, thanks his reviver, and goes his way.[308]  In one of the numerous variants of the story in which a prince is exposed to various dangers by his sister--who is induced to plot against his life by her demon lover, the Snake--the hero is sent in search of "a healing and a vivifying water," preserved between two lofty mountains which cleave closely together, except during "two or three minutes" of each day. He follows his instructions, rides to a certain spot, and there awaits the hour at which the mountains fly apart. "Suddenly a terrible hurricane arose, a mighty thunder smote, and the two mountains were torn asunder. Prince Ivan spurred his heroic steed, flew like a dart between the mountains, dipped two flasks in the waters, and instantly turned back." He himself escapes safe and sound, but the hind legs of his horse are caught between the closing cliffs, and smashed to pieces. The magic waters, of course, soon remedy this temporary inconvenience.[309]  In a Slovak version of this story, a murderous mother sends her son to two mountains, each of which is cleft open once in every twenty-four hours--the one opening at midday and the other at midnight; the former disclosing the Water of Life, the latter the Water of Death.[310] In a similar story from the Ukraine, mention is made of two springs of healing and life-giving water, which are guarded by iron-beaked ravens, and the way to which lies between grinding hills. The Fox and the Hare are sent in quest of the magic fluid. The Fox goes and returns in safety, but the Hare, on her way back, is not in time quite to clear the meeting cliffs, and her tail is jammed in between them. Since that time, hares have had no tails.[311]  On the Waters of Strength and Weakness much stress is laid in many of the tales about the many-headed Snakes which carry off men's wives and daughters to their metallic castles. In one of these, for instance, the golden-haired Queen Anastasia has been torn away by a whirlwind from her husband "Tsar Byel Byelyanin" [the White King]. As in the variant of the story already quoted,[312] her sons go in search of her, and the youngest of them, after finding three palaces--the first of copper, the second of silver, the third of gold, each containing a princess held captive by Vikhor, the whirlwind--comes to a fourth palace gleaming with diamonds and other precious stones. In it he discovers his long-lost mother, who gladly greets him, and at once takes him into Vikhor's cellar. Here is the account of what ensued.    Well, they entered the cellar; there stood two tubs of water,   the one on the right hand, the other on the left. Says the   Queen--    "Take a draught of the water that stands on the right   hand." Prince Ivan drank of it.    "Now then, how strong do you feel?" said she.    "So strong that I could upset the whole palace with one   hand," he replied.    "Come now, drink again."    The Prince drank once more.    "How strong do you feel now?" she asked.    "Why now, if I wanted, I could give the whole world a   jolt."    "Oh that's plenty then! Now make these tubs change   places--that which stands on the right, set on the left: and   that which is on the left, change to the right."    Prince Ivan took the tubs and made them change places.   Says the Queen--    "See now, my dear son; in one of these tubs is the 'Water   of Strength,' in the other is the 'Water of Weakness.'[313] He   who drinks of the former becomes a mighty hero, but he who   drinks of the second loses all his vigor. Vikhor always quaffs   the Strong Water, and places it on the right-hand side; therefore   you must deceive him, or you will never be able to hold   out against him."  The Queen proceeds to tell her son that, when Vikhor comes home, he must hide beneath her purple cloak, and watch for an opportunity of seizing her gaoler's magic mace.[314] Vikhor will fly about till he is tired, and will then have recourse to what he supposes is the "Strong Water;" this will render him so feeble that the Prince will be able to kill him. Having received these instructions, and having been warned not to strike Vikhor after he is dead, the Prince conceals himself. Suddenly the day becomes darkened, the palace quivers, and Vikhor arrives; stamping on the ground, he becomes a noble gallant, who enters the palace, "holding in his hands a battle mace." This Prince Ivan seizes, and a long struggle takes place between him and Vikhor, who flies away with him over seas and into the clouds. At last, Vikhor becomes exhausted and seeks the place where he expects to find the invigorating draught on which he is accustomed to rely. The result is as follows:    Dropping right into his cellar, Vikhor ran to the tub which   stood on the right, and began drinking the Water of Weakness.   But Prince Ivan rushed to the left, quaffed a deep draught of   the Water of Strength, and became the mightiest hero in the   whole world. Then seeing that Vikhor was perfectly enfeebled,   he snatched from him his keen faulchion, and with a single   blow struck off his head. Behind him voices began to cry:    "Strike again! strike again! or he will come to life!"    "No," replied the Prince, "a hero's hand does not strike   twice, but finishes its work with a single blow." And straightway   he lighted a fire, burnt the head and the trunk, and scattered   the ashes to the winds.[315]  The part played by the Water of Strength in this story may be compared with "the important share which the exhilarating juice of the Soma-plant assumes in bracing Indra for his conflict with the hostile powers in the atmosphere," and Vikhor's sudden debility with that of Indra when the Asura Namuchi "drank up Indra's strength along with a draught of wine and soma."[316]  Sometimes, as has already been remarked, one of the two magic waters is even more injurious than the Water of Weakness.[317] The following may be taken as a specimen of the stories in which there is introduced a true Water of Death--one of those deadly springs which bear the same relation to the healing and vivifying founts that the enfeebling bears to the strengthening water. The Baba Yaga who figures in it is, as is so often the case, replaced by a Snake in the variant to which allusion has already been made.
