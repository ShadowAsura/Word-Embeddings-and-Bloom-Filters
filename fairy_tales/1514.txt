. Erdélyi, iii. 1.   Arany gives the following variants of this tale: _Mailath_ 2, _Grimm_[70] 53, and _Schott_, Wallachische Märchen 5. See also in Russian poetry by Pushkin, in Bodenstedt's translation i. p. 100. In the German variants, twelve pigmies take the place of the twelve robbers in the Hungarian tale; and the queen thus addresses her mirror:      "Spieglein, spieglein an der Wand     Wer ist die schönste im ganzen Land?"   And receives the reply--      "Frau Königin. Thr seid die Schönste hier     Aber Schneewitchen ist thausendmal schöner.                              Als Thr."   Cf. Pedroso _Portuguese Folk-Tales_, F.L.S. 1882. "The Vain Queen," and "The Maiden with the Rose on her Forehead."  _Page 164._ The love-stricken ones is a touch of the Oriental method of describing the power of love. See numberless examples in Payne's _Arabian Knights_.  _Page 165._ There is an Indian superstition noted in Temple's _Legends of the Punjáb_, p. 51, where we read, "he wore some coarse clothes over his own, so that her perspiration should not injure him," and in the footnote: "the woman's perspiration would take his 'virtue' out of him."  _Page 165._ Magic Mirror. Besides the variants at the beginning of the notes, we may compare the Magic Mirror in the Norse Saga, "King Gram" and the Hanoverian tale, in _Grimm_, vol. ii. p. 379.  For spitting as a mode of enchantment, see numerous examples in _Arabian Nights_.  _Page 172._ "The Pin, &c. which prevents the girl from moving." Cf. Stokes, _Indian Fairy Tales_, p. xiii., "The Pomegranate King,"  p. 14, "The princess who loved her father like salt," p. 165; and notes on pp. 248, &c.  In the Finnish tale, "Här' än Korwista syntyneet Koirat siw" (Dogs which sprang from the ears of a bull), in _S. ja T._ 1, a girl scratches her brother's head with a devil's tusk, and so kills him; but his faithful dogs lick the wound, and so restore him to life.  In a Lapp story, "Bondesønnen" (_Friis_, No. 44) the son's sister awakes, when the hero pricks her hand, and sucks the drop of blood off.  Cf. Schott, _Wallachische Märchen_, p. 251.

Halliwell, _Nursery Rhymes and Tales_, "The Red Bull of Norroway," p. 169. Thorpe, _Yule-Tide Stories_, p. 40, "The Princess that came out of the water." Payne, _Arabian Nights_, vol. i. p. 375. _Gubernatis_, vol. ii. p. 15, and a story from near Leghorn, p. 242, where it states that similar stories are to be found in Piedmont, in other parts of Tuscany, in Calabria, &c. and in the _Tuti-Name_. _Grimm_, vol. ii. p. 243, "The Glass Coffin." _Pentamerone_, "Sun, Moon, and Talia," and "The Three Citrons." Gonzenbach, _Sicilianiasches Märchen_, vol. i. p. 82.[71] _Old Deccan Days_, "Little Surya Bai," p. 83; "Chundun Rajah," p. 233; "Sodewa Bai," p. 240. In the two last, we also have examples of bodies remaining undecayed for months after death. Sodewa Bai looked as lovely a month after her death as on the night she died; cf. also the well-known "Sleeping Beauty."  The prince in the Greek story weeps and groans over a picture, just as this prince does over his dead princess.
