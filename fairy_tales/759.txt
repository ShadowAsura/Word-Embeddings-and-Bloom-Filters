   One day a wolverine was out walking on the hillside, when, on turning a corner, he suddenly saw a large rock.  'Was that you I heard walking about just now?' he asked, for wolverines are cautious animals, and always like to know the reasons of things.  'No, certainly not,' answered the rock; 'I don't know how to walk.'  'But I _saw_ you walking,' continued the wolverine.  'I am afraid that you were not taught to speak the truth,' retorted the rock.  'You need not speak like that, for I have _seen_ you walking,' replied the wolverine, 'though I am quite sure that you could never catch _me_!' and he ran a little distance and then stopped to see if the rock was pursuing him; but, to his vexation, the rock was still in the same place. Then the wolverine went up close, and struck the rock a blow with his paw, saying: 'Well, will you catch me _now_?'  'I can't walk, but I can _roll_,' answered the rock.  And the wolverine laughed and said: 'Oh, that will do just as well'; and began to run down the side of the mountain.  At first he went quite slowly, 'just to give the rock a chance,' he thought to himself; but soon he quickened his pace, for he found that the rock was almost at his heels. But the faster the wolverine ran, the faster the rock rolled, and by-and-by the little creature began to get very tired, and was sorry he had not left the rock to itself. Thinking that if he could manage to put on a spurt he would reach the forest of great trees at the bottom of the mountain, where the rock could not come, he gathered up all his strength, and instead of running he leaped over sticks and stones, but, whatever he did, the rock was always close behind him. At length he grew so weary that he could not even see where he was going, and catching his foot in a branch he tripped and fell. The rock stopped at once, but there came a shriek from the wolverine:  'Get off, get off! can't you see that you are on my legs?'    [Illustration:
