Pillows of the same sort appear in "The Pelican," p. 255, and remind us of the superstitions connected with wild birds' feathers. In many parts of Lincolnshire, it is said, that it is impossible to die on a bed that contains them. I know of one old lady in Yorkshire, who when _in extremis_ begged to be moved off her bed, as she was sure she could not die on it, as it had some bad feathers in it. In some places it is pigeon's feathers that the people particularly dislike.
