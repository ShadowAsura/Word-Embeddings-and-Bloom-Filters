  That evening, when the princesses went upstairs to bed, he followed them barefoot, so that he might make no noise, and hid himself under one of the twelve beds, so as not to take up much room.  The princesses began at once to open their wardrobes and boxes. They took out of them the most magnificent dresses, which they put on before their mirrors, and when they had finished, turned themselves all round to admire their appearances.  Michael could see nothing from his hiding-place, but he could hear everything, and he listened to the princesses laughing and jumping with pleasure. At last the eldest said, ‘Be quick, my sisters, our partners will be impatient.’ At the end of an hour, when the Star Gazer heard no more noise, he peeped out and saw the twelve sisters in splendid garments, with their satin shoes on their feet, and in their hands the bouquets he had brought them.  ‘Are you ready?’ asked the eldest.  ‘Yes,’ replied the other eleven in chorus, and they took their places one by one behind her.  Then the eldest Princess clapped her hands three times and a trap door opened. All the princesses disappeared down a secret staircase, and Michael hastily followed them.  As he was following on the steps of the Princess Lina, he carelessly trod on her dress.  ‘There is somebody behind me,’ cried the Princess; ‘they are holding my dress.’  ‘You foolish thing,’ said her eldest sister, ‘you are always afraid of something. It is only a nail which caught you.’
