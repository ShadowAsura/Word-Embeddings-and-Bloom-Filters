. text in the Bibl. Palatina at Florence, printed in _Cathay and the Way Thither_, p. 51.  The womankind of dog-headed people are always described as beautiful. Cf. the travels of Friar Jordanus, Odoric of Pordenone, Ibn Batuta. Cf. also the lovely wife of old Doghead in "Prince Mirkó" in this volume; and _Gubernatis_, vol. i. Preface, xix.  _Page 120._ "Born with a caul."  In Holderness and North Lincolnshire, a caul is said to prevent the owner from drowning. I have heard others say, that you can tell by its condition what the state of its owner's (the one who was born with it) health is, even if he (or she) is in a distant land. So long as it keeps as it is he is well, but if it "snerkles up" he is dead.[55] It is commonly called a "sillyhood" in the North.  Cf. _Henderson_, pp. 22, 23. _Aubrey, Remaines of Gentilisme_, p. 113.  Gregor, _Folk-Lore of North-East of Scotland_, p. 25.  _Grimm_, i. Hans in Luck. "I must have been born with a caul," p. 329.  Napier, _Folk-Lore_, p. 32.  Babies born with teeth are said by the Magyar peasants to be the children of witches; see Varga János, _A babonák Könyve_, Arad, 1877, p. 70.  Babies born with teeth are regarded as different to other children, in some parts of England, but the superstition is vague. A friend had a servant who was born with a grey lock, and the writer has often seen the girl; it was regarded as somewhat uncanny. Francisque Michel mentions in his _Histoire des Races Maudites_, that in the Valley of Argelès old women, when quarrelling with a cagot, shew their tongue "ou derrier l'oreille"; this is to remind the poor man of the wisp of hair on his ear, which is considered uncanny.  _Page 120_. The incident of the lad disguising himself so as to be exactly like his comrades occurs also at p. 241, in "The Secret-Keeping Little Boy." To be able to select the right person from several is looked upon as a test of the magic power of the person tried as in this case.  Cf. _Naaké_. "Golden Hair," p. 107.  _Vernaleken_.

Cf. _Folk-Lore Record_, 1880, "Mons Tro," p. 220.  _Page 121._ In the Lapp story, "Patto-Poadnje." _Friis_, p. 78, the Stallo's wife suspects there is something wrong with the soup, which is in reality made of her late husband, but the man fools her by saying he cut his finger while making it.  In the Finnish story, "Tynnyrissä kaswanut Poika," ("The Boy who grows in a Barrel"), _S. ja T._ i., p. 105, there are nine cakes made of a woman's milk. Cf. "How the widow saved her son's life," _Sagas from the Far East_, p. 207.  We may here note the constant difficulties that appear in the folk-tales, and thwart the love-making of the heroes and heroines. Commonly it is the king who does all he can to prevent the lovers being happy, or it is some one at home who causes infinite trouble. For examples of the tasks that the lover or husband has to accomplish, see the tales "Fisher Joe," "Handsome Paul," "Fairy Elizabeth," "The Three Brothers," "The Girl with the Golden Hair," &c., in this volume.  Cf. also _Friis_. "Ruobba. Jætten og Fanden," p. 67; "Bondesønnen. Kongesønnen og Solens Søster," p. 140; "Solkongens Datter," p. 152; "Gutten, som tjente hos Kongen," p. 167.  _S. ja T._ ii.
