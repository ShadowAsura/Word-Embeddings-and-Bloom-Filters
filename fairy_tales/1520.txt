. Erdélyi iii. 9.   In a Finnish Tale, "Weljiänsä-etsijät Tyttö," _S. ja T_. i. p. 119, the girl who seeks her brothers, the girl is warned by a faithful dog, from going near or touching water which a witch wishes her to do, and which entails misery on her; as also in another, "Leppapölky," where the witch tempts the heroes in like manner. Cf. Geldart's _Folk-Lore of Modern Greece_. "Starbright and Birdie," p. 33. _Grimm_, "Brother and Sister." _Gubernatis_, vol. i., pp. 175, 354, and 390.  _P. 221_. The cutting off of the lock of hair reminds us of the widespread superstitions connected with hair, or any other part of a person. Cf. _ante_ pp. 332 and 374. _Archaeology_, "The Physicians of Myddfai," p. 113. I have also often heard the following in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. That you must not give a lock of hair to anyone, or else you will quarrel with that person; that you must not keep the hair of a dead person unless it is "made up," or you will have ill-luck; and that all hair cuttings and nail parings ought to be saved and placed in the coffin, so that the person may "enter heaven perfect!" A baby's hair and nails must not be cut until it is a year old, or else it will be a thief. Hair must not be cut when the moon is waning. It is also said that ague can be cured by hanging a lock of hair on a willow tree.[74]  _Page 223._ The witch wishes to get rid of the deer, in the same way that the gipsy does the golden duck, _ante_ p. 215. Cf. Stokes's _Indian Fairy Tales:_ "The Pomegranate King," p. 10; "Phúlmati Ráni," p. 4; "The Jackal and the Kite," p. 22; "The Bél-Princess," p. 144; and Notes, pp. 245-253. _Gubernatis_, vol. i., p. 412, and vol. ii., p. 31.  _Page 223._ In the Lapp Story, "Pigen fra Havet," _Friis_, No. 8,[75] a child is brought down to the sea-shore to bring mother back; and in the Finnish story, "Ihmeelinen Koiwu," The wonderful Birch, the child's cry brings mother back, just as the little deer's lament in this tale reaches the sister's ears at the bottom of the well.  In this Finnish tale the mother replies, and says to the reindeer, which are feeding near:      "Reindeer! Reindeer! feeding in the swamp,     Come and take care of your child!     Come and see the child you have borne!     For the witch's daughter has neither food nor drink,     And cannot quiet its cries."
